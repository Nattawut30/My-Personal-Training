# if__name__ == __main__: (This cript can be imported OR run standalone)
#                         Functions and classes in this module can be reused
#                         without the main block of code executing

# Good practice (Code is modular,
#               helps readability,
#               leaves no global variable,
#               avoid unintended execution)

#   ex. library = Import library for functionality
#   When running library directly, display a help page

# Define your 'main' function
def main():
    # Your program goes here

# Put this as recall 'main' function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
# Put this at the end of your def 'main' code

# Use the files: example2.py + example3.py to understand more
